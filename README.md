[DEMO](https://hungryvito.github.io/crime_scan/)

Crime Scan is a project to improve the default map local police websites provide in order to visualize the crime level situtation in the area. Two use cases could be improved:

1. The markers based by type overlap, resulting in less violent crime covering everything else (e.g. car theft type overlaps violent crime types).
2. The markers of the only type displayed overlap each other, making it harder to figure out the level of crime density in the neighbourhood.

I also needed a real-life application for the tools I wanted to work on: [@use-supercluster](https://github.com/leighhalliday/use-supercluster) and [@google-map-react](https://github.com/google-map-react/google-map-react).

*DISCLAIMER* 

At the moment the demo shows the static data I simulated based on the [Toronto Police's Major Crime Indicators API](https://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/TorontoPS::major-crime-indicators-open-data/about). 
The initial plan is to integrate the API with a year of data, division grouping and crime type markers.
